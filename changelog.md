### 0.1.3

- First new release

### 0.1.03

- Adds a menu to the context dropdown for the Scene Directory menus to shut all doors in the selected scene to prepare it for a fresh visit from characters. The Doors that are currently locked remain locked, and are not closed.
- Adds a menu to the context dropdown for the Scene Directory menus to delete fog in the selected scene to prepare it for a fresh visit from characters. I find it useful after QAing a new map for holes in walls/doors and checking lighting, etc.
- Add on the folder scene context options the two options for hide all the scene on the naviagtion bar or show all.

### 0.1.02

v9 update
